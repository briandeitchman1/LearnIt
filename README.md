Cheat sheet studying/personal website
This website allows users to create cheat sheets with flashcards and multiple choice questions. The questions are then saved to a Mongo Atlas database. They can be updated, edited and deleted. Anyone can look at the cheat sheets so it can be used for a group study session, but only the owner can edit them.
The site uses Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. The view engine is EJS and authorization is handled using the Passport API. The Spelling Bee game implements the Web Speech API.
